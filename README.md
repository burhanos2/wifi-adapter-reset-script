# wifi-adapter-reset-script
this is something i made to combat the terrible school wifi not working
it needs to run in administrator to work


its best to make a shortcut for this that automatically asks for admin rights, this is how:
1. make a shortcut for the .bat file (right click then either 'create shortcut' OR 'send to' > 'desktop'
2. right click the shortcut you made
3. click on 'Properties'
4. click on 'Advanced'
5. check 'Run as administrator'
6. press ok twice to close the windows


you can also make the shortcut execute on a key combination:
1. right click the shortcut you made
2. click on 'Properties'
3. look at 'shortcut key' and edit that to what you want it to be
4. using it: the shortcut works when you are inside an application, it does not seem to work when you're on your desktop
